# Sudoku-Solver

This exercise helped me brush up on my object-oriented programming, and I realised how important it is to structure my code properly and making it more readable.
I made used of a backtracking algorithm which I found out was actually the most common way of solving sudoku. In the future, I would like to explore and try out more 
on recursive, as I think it would make the code shorter and faster.
