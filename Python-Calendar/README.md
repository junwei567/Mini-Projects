# PythonCalendar
This little exercise helped me to understand more of Python's indentation and formatting, dealing with new lines and nested for loops.

I used a Mathematical alogrithm called Gauss's algorithm to determine the first day of the year. I also had to determine if it was a leap year to calculate the number of days in the particular year. From there, I could generate the yearly calendar with the parameters I had.
